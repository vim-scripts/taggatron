A simple tag file manager for Vim
------------------------------------------------

Are you managing your tag files manually? Are you constantly trying to recall the right command line arguments for ctags-exuberant? Would you like a very light tag manager to solve your problems? Look no further.

Taggatron allows you to set up rules for creating your tag files, based on the language. It separates tag files for different languages (I decided this was the way I wanted to go, as it is neater and easier to maintain), and incorporates the Autotag script by Craig Emery to update tag files incrementally as you edit your files.

For information on how to configure and use Taggatron, go to the source code repository on github: https://github.com/joonty/vim-taggatron
